# Bank-C
This is a simple **ATM Simulation Program** written in C.   
It demonstrates the use of: 
- Loops 
- Conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`) 
- Cross-platform delay (`sleep_ms`) 
- "Press any key to continue" functionality

The program allows a user to:
1. Deposit money  
2. Check balance  
3. Withdraw money  
4. Exit the system
